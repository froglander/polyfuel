# polyfuel

##Final Project: polyfuel (for lack of a better name)

###Description
Gas mileage tracking app written in React and React-Native that will allow a user to easily track their cars’ fuel efficiency over time.

###Proposed Features
* Data will be stored in database linked to user account so if you ever have to delete app from mobile device you won’t lose data
* Future data mining effort would include ways to compare efficiency to other users with the same vehicle using app
* We will be using Leankit kanban board (free version) for tracking the project
* Going to use Balsamiq for creating wireframes
* Maybe include a way that a user can upload a picture of their car?
* When setting up a new car, must include make, model, year, trim and if you want to track fill-ups by tripodomenter or odometer
* Need way to save complete fill-up vs partial fill-up
* Defer MPG until next full fill up
* Show mpg as a graph
* Show average mpg and last fill up mpg
* Way to display list of fill up details - also way to edit them if needed
* Easy input for fill up data
* User stays logged in while on phone so you don’t have to constantly re-login or something
##Why it is valuable
The existing apps that I have looked at with this capability have not had a very good UI experience. Also, ones that I have used are lacking a way to save the data somewhere other than on device where app resides.
Existing options (need further research)
* Car Care - location settings
* http://www.fuelly.com/


##Screens
* Welcome screen (only when first using app)
* User creation/login screen
* Main screen will display graph, avg mpg, last mpg and add new fill-up button
* Details screen will be a list view of all fill ups for that vehicle
* Vehicles screen will allow you to select a different vehicle (or add new one?)
* Add fill-up screen would have spots for miles, gallons, price, (location?), make sure input is the numbers keyboard
